# Udacity-Shopping-Cart-Project

Udacity Front End Development Project

This is my very first web development project using the programming language JavaScript.
In this project I was required to demonstrate my ability to apply the knowledge and basic skills that I learned in this portion of the course.
This project is a simulation of a fruit stand shopping cart.
I was required to program the shopping cart to function like an online store.
Functions include; adding items to the cart, increasing and decreasing quantities, emptying the cart, calculating money received as well as any balance owed.
